This project investigates the application of Gaussian Process Regression to the localization and
mapping problems. Bayes-Filter-based techniques have been very successful in solving the
localization problem in the cases where the accurate prediction and observation models are
available. In other cases, where these models are too complex to obtain using the parametric
approach, a supervised learning algorithm such as the Gaussian Process Regression may be a
more flexible, and hence, superior alternative. The main objective of this project is to develop a
customized implementation of Gaussian Process Regression that is capable of building accurate
observation models from sparse training data. This observation model may also be used to
construct the map of the entire environment.
